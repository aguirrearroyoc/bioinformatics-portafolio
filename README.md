## Projects

###  Blood–Brain Barrier Penetration Prediction (Machine Learning)

**Objective:**  
Develop a QSAR machine learning model to predict whether small molecules can cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB), a critical step in CNS drug discovery.

**Methods & Tools:**
- Dataset: BBBP (Kaggle)
- Molecular representation: Morgan fingerprints (ECFP4)
- Model: Random Forest Classifier
- Evaluation: ROC AUC, precision, recall, F1-score
- Libraries: RDKit, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy

**Key Results:**
- ROC AUC ≈ **0.94**
- High sensitivity for BBB-permeable compounds
- Suitable for early-stage compound screening
